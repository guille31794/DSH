Search with a file explorer for the file that we have previously copied to the device, and install the application normally.
Download the markers from the following link:



Place the versions A of these markers on a surface without wrinkling, and place their version B, corresponding to adjust the scale of the image that we want to represent, similarly on a surface.

User manual

The app operatio system is simple. Once opened, the main menu appears and the operation through all the menus is done by tapping on the screen on the colored and labeled buttons.

Once in the gallery scene of the day you want to observe, just point to the markers placed on a smooth surface for the images of the gallery to appear.

If there are problems in detecting the markers, check that the lighting is clear enough, and that the camera lens is capable of focusing on the markers.
